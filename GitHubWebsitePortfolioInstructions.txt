So, you want to create a GitHub Website Portfolio…

The first thing to do is to go to GitHub:
https://github.com
If there’s a silhouette of an Octocat in the corner of the screen, you’re probably in the right place.

Once there, sign up for GitHub.  All you needs is: email, password and username.

Once you take care of the email verification, you will have a brand new GitHub account.  Congratulations!

Now you’re going to want to create a repository.  
Go to the “Repositories” tab, and click “New” (Look for the green button on the right side of the screen).

Name your repository.

Now you need something to put into the repository. 

Using an editor of your choice create a HTML file.

If you need an editor, one option is Visual Studio Code, which I used for my first GitHub webpage, which can be downloaded here: 
https://code.visualstudio.com

If you want to learn about how to create a HTML file, you may want to check out this resource: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML

Once you have created the files you need, then you can then add them to your repository, and commit the changes.  

You have now created a GitHub Website Portfolio!
